This is the main repository for the **DollarNow** ecosystem, a suite of tools for real-time currency exchange rates. It is organized as a monorepo to facilitate code sharing and maintenance.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Package Structure

The monorepo is managed with `npm workspaces` and contains the following packages:

### `/packages/webapp`

The main web application, built with SvelteKit and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. It offers a complete interface for currency conversion.

*   **Access**: dollarnow.app
*   **Read more**: `packages/webapp/README.md`

### `/packages/api`

A robust serverless API built with Cloudflare Workers. It fetches rates from multiple sources (Wise as primary, AwesomeAPI as a fallback) and serves them in a standardized format.

*   **Read more**: `packages/api/README.md`

### `/packages/extension`

A Google Chrome extension that allows users to view rates and perform conversions directly from the browser toolbar.

*   **Read more**: `packages/extension/README.md`

### `/packages/shared`

An internal package containing code shared across other packages, such as TypeScript types, constants (currency lists, metadata), and utility functions. This ensures consistency and avoids code duplication.

### `/packages/assets`

A simple package that centralizes static assets, like SVG flag icons, used by both the `webapp` and the `extension`.
