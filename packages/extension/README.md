## üõ†Ô∏è How to Install for Development

Since the extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you can load it locally to test or use it.

### 1. Build the Extension

Because this extension uses code and assets from the `shared` and `assets` packages, you must first run a build script. This script prepares a `dist` folder with all the necessary files in a format the browser can understand.

From the **root of the monorepo**, run:
```bash
npm run build:extension
```
This will create a `dist` folder inside `packages/extension`. This `dist` folder is what you will load into Chrome.

### 2. Load the Extension in Chrome

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ricardodelfino/dollarnow.git
    cd dollarnow
    ```

2.  **Open Google Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

3.  **Enable "Developer mode"** in the top right corner.

4.  Click on **"Load unpacked"**.

5.  In the file dialog, select the **`packages/extension/dist`** folder.

6.  Done! The DollarNow extension will appear in your list and be active in your browser.
